A teleoperator is a system or machine that is operated remotely from a distance.
While the term is similar in meaning to "remote control," it is more commonly encountered in research, academia, and technology.

Teleoperation enables humans to operate machines and systems remotely, extending our capabilities across distances

## Definition

Teleoperation refers to the operation of a device or machine by a person from a distance. 
It's often associated with robotics and mobile robots but can apply to various situations where remote control is necessary.

## Historical Context

In the 19th century, inventors worked on remotely operated weapons, including torpedoes. Notable examples include John Louis Lay, John Ericsson, and Victor von Scheliha.

Nikola Tesla demonstrated a remotely controlled boat with a wireless radio guidance system in 1898, although it was not adopted by the U.S. military.

## Applications
- Industrial Machinery: Teleoperation is commonly used in hazardous environments, such as constructing structures like the Object Shelter at Chernobyl or removing debris after rock slides.
- Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs): These are extensively used in radioactive, contaminated, and deep ocean environments.
- Remote Surgery: Surgeons can perform procedures using teleoperated robotic systems.
- Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (Drones): Drones are teleoperated for various purposes.
- Teleoperation of Autonomous Vehicles: To bridge the gap between current self-driving capabilities and widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles, teleoperation assists self-driving cars in challenging situations or edge cases where confidence in autonomous decision-making is low.

## Hobby Industry

Teleoperation is also making its way into the hobby industry through first-person view (FPV) equipment.

FPV setups allow operators to control hobby cars, planes, and helicopters beyond line-of-sight range, providing a TV-style transmission back to the operator.
